1] Explain Java and Javac
     Java: It is a highly level object oriented Programming Language.
           Java command  is used run the program.

     JavaC:
         Javac is compand in java used to Compile the source code to byte code.

2]Explain JDK,JRE,JVM.
   JVM:Java Virtual Machine
       provides the runtime environment in which java exceutes the byte code.
       tasks are:
          * Loads the program
          * verifies the program
          * Executes the program

   JRE:Java Runtime Environment
       JVM + Set of libraries
   
   JDK:Java Development Kit
       JRE + Development tools
          development tools are:compiler,debugger etc 

3]List the Limitations of array.
    we cannot stored the different datatype
     
4]Explain Class ,object, and signature of the class.
    Class: It is a blueprint,template,designing contains states and behaviour.
        class Speaker{
            public static void main(String[] args)
            System.out.println("power on");
           }
    Object:object is a instance of a class, used to create a multiple copies of class when object is created.
        Syntax:classname refname=new constructor();
               
  Signature of the class:
            class ClassName{
               

            }
5] Difference between .java file and .class file
     .java file:
         * In .java file the readbility is visible clearly
         * for an source code by using .java file
          
     .class file:
          * In .class file the not readbility
          * when compile byte code by using .class file.
 
6]Explain the method signature.
    <access specifiers> return type <method name>(parameters1,parameters2,.......)
   {
    //block of codes
    return;
  }
access specifiers:4 methods
    public :accessed in all the class ,package,sub class.
    private:accessed in same class.
    protected:accessed in package and same class
    Default:accessed in same class,same package,subclass.
return type:returns the datatypes
Method name:name of a method

7]what is java?
    Java is a high level object oriented Programming language.
   highlevel:human readable
   object oriented:data and behaviour.
   Programming Language:set of activities that combined to perform some specific tasks.

8]List of java IDE's
     java IDE's are :intelji,visual studio,Eclipse,notepad++.

9]what is variable? and its types.
    variable is a container which is used holds the data.
       Syntax:
                 datatypa variablename = data/value;
   4 types of variables:
     * Local variable
     * static variable
     * instance variable
     * parameter variable
          local variable:declared inside the method.
               eg:class Vegetables{
                     int price=90;
                     String color="green";
                   public static void main(String[] args)
                       {
                   System.out.println("the price of vegetables"+price);
                   System.out.println("the color of vegetables"+color);
                 }
             }
         Static variable:declared outside the method.by using the static keyword.
             class Vegetables{
                   static  int price=90;
                    static String color="green";
                   public static void main(String[] args)
                       {
                   System.out.println("the price of vegetables"+price);
                   System.out.println("the color of vegetables"+color);
                 }
             }
        instance variable:declared outside the method without using the static keyword.
        parameter variable:the variable declared inside the parathensis of the method name.
                   class Vegetables{
                  public static void add(int a ,int b){
                         add=a+b;
                   }
10]list 15 java Keywords.
    * int 
    * float
    * double
    * short
    * byte 
    * char
    * boolean  
    * long 
    * extend
    * try 
    * catch
    * System
    * public
    * String
    * private 

11] what is class variable?
12]what is data type and explain its data types
     Data type is used to indicate the type of datatype that are stored in the memory is known as datatype.
    types of datatypes:   
        primitive datatype: int ,short,long,double,char,boolean
        non primitive datatypes:String ,class etc.

13]what is dot operator.
      to access the variable and method by using dot operator.

14]list of java features.
     java features are:
         simple: easy to understand
         Robust:very strong .strong memory management
         object orineted:compartable of data and behaviour
         multithearded:performs the multiple tasks
         distributed:facilitates the user to create thedistributed applications
         secure:no expicit pointers,and sandbox.

15]what is the base class of all the classes?
      java .lang

16]what is method overloading? 
      method overloading having a same name but different parameters.
     eg: class Addition{
         public static void main(String[] args)
             { 
         add(45+45);
         add(90+70+80);
         } 
           public void add(int a,int b)
           { 
          System.out.println("adding the first element");
          System.out.println("adding the second element");
          int j=a+b;
          System.out.println(j);
         }
    public void add(int x,int y,int z)
           { 
          System.out.println("adding the first element");
          System.out.println("adding the second element");
          System.out.println("adding the third element");
          int p=x+y+z;
          System.out.println(p);
         }
